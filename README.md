# **OOP Vision: Interactive Web Application for Teaching Object-Oriented Programming**

An innovative web-based platform designed to make learning Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java easier, interactive, and engaging.

---

## **Project Overview**

### **Purpose**
This project aims to simplify the learning process of OOP concepts for beginners using:
- **Interactive Visualisations**: Explaining abstract concepts like objects, classes, and inheritance.
- **Step-by-Step Demonstrations**: Visually representing Java code execution examples.
- **Quizzes**: Enhancing understanding through interactive assessments.

---

## **Features**

- **Interactive Learning Modules**:
  - Visualise the inner workings of Java OOP programs (e.g., object creation and interactions).
  - Step-by-step representation of OOP principles.
- **Quizzes**:
  - Integrated quizzes for learners to assess their understanding.
  - Instant feedback to guide learning.
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Easy navigation for learners to explore topics independently.
- **Progress Tracking**:
  - Personalised tracking to monitor learning progress.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**: Angular Framework with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Hosting**: Azure
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Tools for UI Design**: Lucid, Draw.io and Excalidraw

## **Why This Project?**

Traditional learning tools often fail to provide:
- Adequate **visual representation** of abstract OOP concepts.
- Effective integration of **quizzes** with real-time feedback.

This application bridges the gap by offering both visual and interactive learning solutions tailored for Java programming.

## **Target Audience**

1. **Beginners in Java Programming**:
   - Struggling to understand OOP concepts.
2. **Educators**:
   - Looking for a tool to demonstrate Java OOP principles visually.

---

## **Project Goals**

- Enhance understanding of OOP concepts using **visual aids**.
- Provide an interactive learning environment for **step-by-step comprehension**.
- Incorporate engaging quizzes for better retention.
- Create a scalable, user-friendly web application.
